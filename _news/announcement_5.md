Starting this semester, I'll be hosting weekly NLP Reading Group events with Longju Bai. The event is sponsored by Michigan AI Lab and Rada's group. It welcomes all class levels and scholars from all backgrounds.

People interested in attending in-person or virtually could receive our email communications by clicking "Join Group" on our [MCommunity page](https://mcommunity.umich.edu/group/NLP%20Reading%20Group). Snacks and drinks will be provided!
