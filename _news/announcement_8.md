Well, this announcement is actually written after I'm back to Ann Arbor. Long story short, transformative experience: Not only for the weather (indeed amazing compared to the gloomy days in Ann Arbor), but also for the coolest folks I met during the conference (great professors and PhDs). People say conferences tend to create a hallucination that academia is chill, but honestly, I'll accept this hallucination. I couldn't express how much I enjoy socializing with like-minded people. 

Have to stop here, or I'll keep writing forever.
