Our paper ["The Generation Gap: Exploring Age Bias in the Value Systems of Large Language Models"](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1094/) was accepted at EMNLP 2024. Big kudos to Siyang and Rada for their supervision.   

P.S. This announcement was actually written after I'm back from Miami. Long story short, transformative experience: Not only for the weather (indeed amazing compared to the gloomy days in Ann Arbor), but also for the coolest folks I met during the conference (great professors and PhDs). People say conferences tend to create a hallucination that academia is chill, but honestly, I'll accept this hallucination. I couldn't express how much I enjoy socializing with like-minded people. 

Have to stop here, or I'll keep writing forever.
