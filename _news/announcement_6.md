I presented my poster on an ongoing project with Aylin, Rada, and Vero at e-HAIL 2024 (E-Health & Artificial Intelligence). In this project, we release a dataset of Spanish motivational interviews and explore the linguistic difference between Spanish and English counseling. Our findings and experiments are presented in the [poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SZAw7kKu9MBxOH_ANutWhRAEt2o8saoL7tgivoRcGoU/edit?usp=sharing). 

Please stay attuned to our work! We plan to submit this paper to NAACL 2025.
