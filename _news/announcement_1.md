I embarked on an academic journey with the Blablablab, under the supervision of Professor Jurgens and Card. I will be mentored by Ben Litterier, a PhD candidate, on a large-scale project regarding podcasts.

Interestingly, my first day at school was marked by an unprecedented campus-wide blackout. Despite the darkness, that day remains bright in my memory!
