Joined the Blablablab and began an academic odyssey! I will work with Ben Litterier (PhD candidate) on his podcast project, along with a fellow undergraduate student Irena Li. 

Was the first school day with an unprecedented campus-wide black out. However, that day will be remembered in a bright way by me!
