I embarked on an academic journey with the Blablablab, under the guidance of Professor Jurgens. I am thrilled to collaborate with Ben Litterier, a PhD candidate, and Irena Li, a fellow Computer Science major, on a podcast project.

Interestingly, my first day at school was marked by an unprecedented campus-wide blackout. Despite the darkness, that day remains the brightest in my memory!
