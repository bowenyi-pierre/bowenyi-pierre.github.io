My LIT lab odyssey began on February 6, 2024, at 11:55 PM. Stepping into Room 3765 of Bob and Betty Beyster Building, I had the privilege to meet with the most fantastic NLP researchers led by the one and the only Rada Mihalcea. Every second of the lab meeting was (and is) a treasure or intellectual gift that must never be missed...

After a month of weekly lab meetings, I become friends with many lab members and visitors. I also turned from a "visitor" to an official lab member. I am fortunate to work on improving the mental health of medical interns by NLP methods. I will also work closely with Veronica, who is a LIT alumna and incoming professor at Texas State. Our project focuses on uncovering the difference in mental health consulting in Spanish and English.   

Roads go ever ever on.

    April 23, meeting at Mujo Cafe. We talked about movies and assigned everyone an English name for fun. My name was Ben. Rada was Rachel, and Siyang was either Sarah or Susan. DJ was Daniel John, the most hilarious name among all.
