My LIT lab odyssey began on February 6, 2024, at 12:00 PM. Stepping into Room 3765 of Bob and Betty Beyster Building, I had the privilege to meet with the most fantastic NLP researchers led by the one and the only Rada Mihalcea. Every second of the lab meeting was (and is) a treasure or intellectual gift that must never be missed... 

After a month of attending weekly lab meetings, I turned from a "visitor" to an official lab member. I am working closely with Siyang Liu, the best Hunan-native researcher in NLP I know! Our research project intends to improve the mental health of medical interns by NLP methods. 

Roads go ever ever on.

    April 23, meeting at Mujo Cafe. We talked about movies and assigned everyone an English name for fun. My name was Ben, same as my mentor :) Rada was Rachel (I guess) and Siyang was either Sarah or Susan. DJ was Daniel John, the most hilarious name among all.
