This afternoon, I gave a 30-minute talk about my research on topic modeling and Mallet. As the first undergraduate student in my lab giving a talk, my presentation was well-accepted and welcomed among Professor Jurgens and graduate students. Here's a link to my presentation slides: https://umich-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/bowenyi_umich_edu/EePerdTGl0ZEuxzaALlRVOUBEvTLc3DVMlkpriPZFm4LSg?e=bzm6Sa 

P.S. An achievement to brag about: I am the first undergraduate in my lab to share research stems (plots) and deliver a 30-minute talk. By being more proactive, I believe I can get most out of my research experience and thus have a better shot at top graduate programs.
