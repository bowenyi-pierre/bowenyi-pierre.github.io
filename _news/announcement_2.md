This afternoon, I gave a 30-minute talk about my research on topic modeling and Mallet. As the first undergraduate student in my lab giving a talk, my presentation was well-accepted and welcomed among Professor Jurgens and graduate students. Here's a link to my presentation PPT: https://umich-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/bowenyi_umich_edu/EePerdTGl0ZEuxzaALlRVOUBEvTLc3DVMlkpriPZFm4LSg?e=bzm6Sa
