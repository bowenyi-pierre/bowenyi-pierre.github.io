This afternoon, I gave a 30-minute talk about my research on topic modeling and Mallet. As the first undergraduate student in my lab giving a talk, my presentation was well-accepted and welcomed among Professor Jurgens and graduate students. Feel free to check out my [https://umich-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/bowenyi_umich_edu/EePerdTGl0ZEuxzaALlRVOUBEvTLc3DVMlkpriPZFm4LSg?e=bzm6Sa](presentation slides!) 

Next semester, I am planning to take a class with Professor Rada Mihalcea and join her lab if possible. I have been admiring Rada for a long time because she is one of the most reputed NLP researchers not just at UMich but in the whole world. I will work jointedly with David and Rada if possible, which will give my graduate school application a boost.
