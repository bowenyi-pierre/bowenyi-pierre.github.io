<!-- Background: From August 2024, my PhD mentor, Ben, started gathering a comprehensive raw dataset, which includes millions of podcasts. These podcasts, ranging from the early 1990s to the present day, offer a rich tapestry of information. We are intrigued by the evolution of podcasts over the decades, especially in terms of their categories, languages used, and how do those factors interact with political events in the US and the world.

For example, some very interesting analysis we did include the shift of popular podcast categories in each US presidency, etc.

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images. -->
