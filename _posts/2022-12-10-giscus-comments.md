July 9, 2023 was my 20th birthday, also one of the happiest and fulfilling birthdays I have ever had. I spent the whole day with my best friend, Mickey, who carefully made a giant birthday cake for me. Words are too plain to express my graititude to my dearest friend, who always wears the warmest and reassuring smile, brings kindness and optimism to people around him, and makes me never feel alone even if I am far away from home.   

The loveliest part is, since I mentioned my movie hero is Forrest Gump before, my friend specially put a Forrest Gump "statue" at the top of the birthday cake. This cake carried the best wishes and the greatest friendship between Mickey and me. It will also stay in my heart and reminds me to keep running and fighting, just like Forrest Gump. 

Long live my dream. Long live my friendship with Mickey "the best"!
