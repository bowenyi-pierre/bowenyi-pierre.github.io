I am composing this post on the inaugural snowy day in Ann Arbor this academic year. The weather outside is more picturesque than cold. As my reflection dances in the windowpanes, I delve into memories of the recent Thanksgiving break:

For Thanksgiving 2024, I was honored to spend the holiday with my housemate’s family in Grand Rapids. It was the second city I had the good fortune to live in Michigan (the first being Ann Arbor).

On the Tuesday preceding Thanksgiving, a kindly aunt offered me a ride to Grand Rapids. I was warmly welcomed by homemade Hunanese cuisine prepared by Mrs. Yang on my first night; a delightful surprise as the Yang family and I all hail from Hunan. The evocative flavors, redolent of my parents' and grandmother's cooking, eased my homesickness considerably, taking refuge in an invitingly decorated study room that served as my bedroom.

On day two, I explored the sprawling, scenic community the family resided in, with easy access to parks, ponds, and trails. The spectacular nature and residential areas coexisted harmoniously, as evidenced by the wildlife I spotted during my afternoon walks. Interestingly, while Ann Arbor is renowned for its rich wildlife, Grand Rapids stood out for its harmonious human-nature coexistence. In the evening, Mr. Yang arranged a sumptuous dinner party where my classmates and I, all Hunanese, introduced two American guests to our spicy cuisine.

The third day was Thanksgiving, and we spent the afternoon exploring Downtown Grand Rapids. The organization of the city was strikingly distinct from Downtown San Diego, which I had visited on a few occasions. The streets, deserted in observance of the holiday, were home to few homeless people, likely due to the cold. We enjoyed a walk along the river at the town center and visited a few significant landmarks, including Mr. Yang's office, several museums and President Ford's burial site (although these were closed).

Our return home at 5:00PM signaled the preparation of a lavish Thanksgiving dinner that featured an eclectic mix of traditional Hunan pork fried with chili, salmon, mussels, chicken, and lobster. We also welcomed a new guest, the erudite Uncle Liu, an alumnus of Peking University. 

BLACK FRIDAY signified the fourth day. Despite not having a specific shopping list, I joined the Yang family for an outlet mall visit to soak in the festive atmosphere. Mr. Yang intended to purchase a few items for his family in China, leading us to brave the early hours and long lines at various stores offering hefty discounts. Upon our departure at 1:00 PM, the outlet mall had amassed a mile-long queue of cars.

On the fifth, also the second last day with the Yang family, Mr. Yang treated me and Frank, my housemate, to a barbeque experience. The smoked ribs, delectably reminiscent of La Rou (腊肉), a popular Hunan dish, were a culinary highlight.

Finally, on Sunday, I bid the Yang family goodbye and returned home with the same kindly aunt, carrying a delicious trove of snacks and food she had packed for dinner. The Yangs are a paradigm of hospitality, their kindness contrasting my far-off home with comforting familiarity. Their story inspires me: Mr. Yang's journey from a hardworking student and parent in Chengdu to fulfilling his American dream resonates with my own aspirations. This unforgettable Thanksgiving break with the Yangs not only enriched me culturally but also fortified my resolve to achieve my goals - not just for myself, but for everyone who supports and loves me. As my mother jokingly mentioned, my father looks forward to a friendly "drinking competition" with Mr. Yang when I secure a good job in the states - a milestone I eagerly anticipate and will work tirelessly towards.
