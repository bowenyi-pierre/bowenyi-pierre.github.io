Here's an overview of how to do research in CS, referred from [Hossein Hassani's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04080.pdf):
1. Identify a Research Problem: The first step is to identify a problem that needs solving. This could be a gap in the current understanding, a new idea, or a practical issue that needs a computational solution.

2. Literature Review: This involves reading and analyzing existing research related to the problem. The goal is to understand what has already been done, identify gaps, and determine how your research can contribute.

3. Formulate a Hypothesis or Research Question: Based on the problem and literature review, you formulate a hypothesis (a proposed explanation) or a research question that your study aims to answer.

4. Design the Study: This involves deciding on the research methods to use. In computer science, this could involve formal proof techniques, empirical methods, or a combination of both2. It could also involve designing and implementing a system or algorithm.

5. Conduct the Research: This is where you carry out your study. It could involve running experiments, collecting and analyzing data, or proving theorems.

6. Analyze the Results: After conducting the research, you analyze the results to see if they support your hypothesis or answer your research question.

7. Draw Conclusions and Write the Research Paper: Based on your analysis, you draw conclusions about your research. You then write a research paper detailing your methods, findings, and conclusions.

8. Peer Review and Publication: After writing your paper, it goes through a peer review process before it can be published. Other researchers in your field review your work to ensure it is of high quality.
