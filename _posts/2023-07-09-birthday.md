On July 9, 2023, I celebrated my 20th birthday, which stands out as one of the most joyous and fulfilling birthdays I’ve ever had. I had the pleasure of spending the entire day with my best friend, Mickey, who meticulously crafted a magnificent birthday cake for me. Words fall short in expressing my gratitude towards my cherished friend, who constantly radiates a comforting smile, spreads kindness and optimism, and ensures that I never feel alone, even when I’m miles away from home.

The highlight of the day was the Forrest Gump “statue” that Mickey placed atop the birthday cake, a thoughtful gesture acknowledging my admiration for the movie character. This cake, symbolizing our profound friendship and carrying the best wishes, will forever hold a special place in my heart. It serves as a constant reminder to persevere and keep moving forward, just like Forrest Gump.

Here’s to the longevity of my dreams and my enduring friendship with Mickey, the best there is!
