I am writing this post on the first Ann-Arborish snowy day this school year. Outside is not cold, but beautiful. Staring at my reflection on the window, I am still thinking through the past Thanksgiving break:
 
2024 Thanksgiving, I was fortunate and honored to spend the holiday with my housemate's family in Grand Rapids. Accurately, it is the second city I stayed in Michigan (with Ann Arbor being the first). 

I set out in Tuesday afternoon to Grand Rapids with a very kind auntie who offered me a ride. The first night, I was welcomed by hometown cuisine made by Mrs. Yang (I and the whole Yang family are Hunan homies). Honestly, the last time I tasted this home-made cuisine was over two years ago made by my parents and granny. The dishes were not only delicious, but carried a relief of my homesickness. Without exploring the community after dinner, I went to sleep at my bedroom (a well-decorated cozy study room on the first floor).

The second day, I was able to explore the community where the family reside. It is absolutely scenic and huge with convenient access to parks, ponds, and trails. The beautiful nature and residential area are intermingled but never disturb one another: I saw a deer relaxing on someone's lawn while walking around in the afternoon. Although Ann Arbor has rich wildlife, Grand Rapids seems to have a better human-nature relationship. That night, Mr. Yang hosted a generous dinner party for me and my classmates who are from Hunan. Two Americans also joined us on the Hunan-style dinner and were brave enough to try some spicy food.

Third day, Thanksgiving. In the afternoon, we visited Downtown Grand Rapids. Compared to Downtown San Diego, which I visited several times, DT Grand Rapids is much more organized. I didn't see many homeless people around (partly because it is too cold to stay outside). Streets were abandoned on the holiday and we were walking along the river at downtown center. I saw a few fishermen stepping into the freezing river trying to hook fish. It's not a salmon season and they didn't seem to have a fish harvest. Later, I visited Mr. yang's office, a few museums, and President Ford's burial site (sadly, they were closed and we only took few photos of them).

At around 5:00, we went back home after the refreshing tour and prepared a grand Thanksgiving dinner. The dinner featured classic pork fried with chili (hunan cuisine), salmon, mussels, chicken, lobster, etc. Also, we welcomed a new guest, uncle Liu, who graduated from Peking University and was such a rarely knowledgeable person. 

Fourth day, BLACK FRIDAY! Although I had nothing specific to buy, I went to the nearby Outlets with the Yang family just to feel the atmosphere. Mr. Yang intended to buy few items for his family in China so we left home early (at 8:00) but already had some trouble finding parking. Later, we visited stores like Coach, Polo, Calvin Klein, and Under Armor, most of which offered 50% discount. When we left Outlets at 1:00 PM, we saw an one-mile car line in front of the Outlets. Fingers crossed for those drivers waiting in line.

Fifth day, also the second last day I spent with the Yang family. Mr. Yang took me and Frank (my housemate) to a BBQ place, which was the first time I tried BBQ. It was an amazing experience and the smoked ribs tasted like La Rou (腊肉, a famous Hunan cuisine which I hadn't tried over two years). That night, I was surprised by how time flied with a tint of regretfulness.

The last day, Sunday, I said goodbye to the Yang family in early afternoon. In the morning, Mr. Yang was so kind that he went to Costco to buy my favorite croissant and roasted chicken for me, since he knew that I could not access Costco in Ann Arbor. I went back home with the same kind auntie and two other school mates: the auntie even prepared snacks and food for me as dinner. Yes, Mr. Yang is kind, and his friends are also kind.  
  

The Yang family are the most hospitable and cordial family and I had been taken good care of over the break. They gave me a long-missing feeling of home, and this feeling has not gone away even the day after I went back. At the same time, Mr. Yang's life is rather inspiring and motivational for me: at the age of 28, he decided to immigrate to the US so he studied extremely hard for PhD admission while taking a full-time job and raising a young kid in Chengdu. The God didn't letbhim down: after all those difficult days, he graduated from his PhD program and landed a stable job in the States. His kids grow up with good care and he has an unbelivably wide adn supportive friend circle. I will never forget this Thanksgiving break, and never forget the kindest treatment of the Yang family to me. As my mom comments, my dad will have a "drinking competition" with Mr. Yang once I land a good job in the US. I'm waiting for that day, and will fight for that day. There's no reason not to fight hard for those people that support and love me.
