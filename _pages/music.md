## What is music?

This question came to me one quiet Thursday night. After finishing my PhD applications, I finally had time to look back on the music that has accompanied me over the years. I realized that music isn't just sound—it's memory. Music from a certain time carries the spirit of that era. And for me, music also captures the state of my mind, my life, at that moment.

As a child, I played the hulusi (葫芦丝) very well. It's an instrument many Chinese kids were nudged into practicing by parents. Back then, I didn’t realize how deeply music would shape me. When school got busier, I gave up music easily. Looking back, that was a mistake as music would later become a quiet companion during the darkest times, a source of healing when words didn’t work.

In secondary school, I entered my teenage years and followed whatever was popular. I listened to whatever my peers did. Ironically, that period marked my most up-to-date and eclectic music taste. Weekly billboard hits were my go-to. But I hadn’t found my music yet. My turbulent, aimless secondary school years echoed with multiple equally aimless songs (no intention to attend the singers).

Everything changed in high school. That’s when music became a comrade. I slowly began to shape my own taste and stuck with it. I remember the turning point clearly: January 1st, 2018. I had a life-changing conversation with Neal about studying abroad. He told me, “We’re young. We’re not meant to stay in our city forever. We should decide our own lives.” Those words shook me—they woke up a part of me that had been asleep for years.

From then on, everything shifted. I became the only student at my school preparing to study abroad. It was a lonely path, but music was there. I still smile thinking about those afternoons—studying English before my one-on-one with Mr. Vincent, lying on my bed during a five-minute break, listening to *Truly Madly Deeply* while the sunlight poured in. Or jogging downstairs with *San Francisco* in my ears, dreaming of the blue skies over Stanford and the green grass in the Bay Area. I hadn’t arrived at Stanford yet, but those songs carried me closer. I remember summer nights too: crickets outside my open window, *Ständchen* or *Just When I Needed You Most* in the background. And I’ll never forget how the *Forrest Gump* suite changed my life one afternoon. As the music reached its climax, something clicked. I suddenly knew I had to give everything I had. Like Forrest, I ran home to study English with all my heart. It was magic.

In college, music helped me find calm. As schoolwork and research duties grew, I lost some of the innocence I used to carry. But music remained a kind of magic potion. During my second year, I stayed up all night with intense rock music while coding—though that’s not quite the case anymore. Most recently, I kept myself awake during a research hackathon with the Chinese song *追梦赤子心*. Music also became something I shared with friends like Mickey and Kyle—a way to spend real, meaningful time together. And now, after four years away from home without seeing my parents, humming the same old tunes is how I relive those moments.

In these 21 years—and the many more to come—music has been a tool, a medicine, a friend, and a form of family. You can learn a lot about someone from their song collection—it’s not a cliché. I’m grateful to every person and experience that music has framed and followed. From childish tunes in my childhood, to chasing hits in my teenage confusion, to now—where each song I love carries a story—I’ve grown into an idealistic, romantic, and imperfect adult. And music has witnessed every step.

As I said in the Mandarin collection:

> I picture a morning in the future—maybe I’m driving a car I don’t yet own, windows down, sunlight streaming in, and these songs playing. Just like Andy in *The Shawshank Redemption*, driving along the Pacific coast. Music weaves into our lives in strange and beautiful ways. Maybe it’s true—music doesn’t just accompany life; it *makes* it.


Yours,  
**Bowen**
