Outside of research, I am a book lover and [movie buff](https://letterboxd.com/bowen20190101/films/). My interests in literature and films span across national borders and time periods. In addition to Chinese and English works, I appreciate Russian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Polish, and Japanese creations (the list goes on). My favorite author and actor are Leo Tolstoy and Tom Hanks, as their works gave me motivation in the darkest time.  

My online records only capture a fraction of my experiences, as some masterpieces can't be described. I may add book and movie reviews to this site in the future, and I welcome any discussions about my interests!
