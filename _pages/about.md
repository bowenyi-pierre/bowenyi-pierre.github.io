It's me, Bowen! As a junior in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, I am very fortunate to research Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science (CSS) with [David Jurgens "the Great"](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), [Dallas Card](https://dallascard.github.io/), and [Benjamin Litterer (as his very first mentee!)](https://twitter.com/BenLitterer). My research integrates NLP and CSS to understand human behavior. You can find our amazing research work at [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/)!  

Before my journey at Michigan, I grew up in [Yueyang, Hunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang). It is a beautiful city nestled by [Dongting Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongting_Lake) and famous for Fan Zhongyan's [Memorial to Yueyang Tower](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E5%B2%B3%E9%99%BD%E6%A8%93%E8%A8%98). I am one of the rare Hunaneses who can't sustain hot spice.    

I am looking forward to PhD application this year. Please reach out to me with any questions!
