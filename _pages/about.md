It's me, Bowen Yi! As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, I research Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Sciences with David Jurgens the Great and Dallas Card. My research combines data analysis and network science together to understand social patterns and human behavior in its social context. You can find our amazing research here at  https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
