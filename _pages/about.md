It's me, Bowen Yi! As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, I research Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Sciences with [David Jurgens "the Great"](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Benjamin Litterer (as his first mentee!)](https://twitter.com/BenLitterer). My research  integrates data analysis and network science to unravel social patterns and comprehend human behavior within its societal context. Additionally, I have a keen interest in exploring the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) within the healthcare sector. You can find our amazing research work at the [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/) website! 

Before my journey at Michigan, I grew up in [Yueyang, Hunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang), a beautiful city nestled by [Dongting Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongting_Lake) and famous for Fan Zhongyan's [Memorial to Yueyang Tower](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E5%B2%B3%E9%99%BD%E6%A8%93%E8%A8%98). I am proud to share my roots with [Zuo Zongtang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo_Zongtang), who is also known as General Tso but has no connection to the popular dish.
