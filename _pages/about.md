It's me, Bowen! A junior in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, I am very fortunate to research Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science with [Dallas Card](https://dallascard.github.io/), [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), and [Rada Mihalcea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rada_Mihalcea). I am also grateful to the mentorship of [Benjamin Litterer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kXhY6pkAAAAJ) (as his very first mentee!) and [Siyang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2OjUAPUAAAAJ&hl=en) (Hunan is honored to be her hometown). You can find more of our amazing research work at [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/) and [LIT](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/)! 

Before my journey at Michigan, I grew up in [Yueyang, Hunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang). It is a beautiful city nestled by [Dongting Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongting_Lake) and famous for Fan Zhongyan's [Memorial to Yueyang Tower](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E5%B2%B3%E9%99%BD%E6%A8%93%E8%A8%98). I am one of the rare Hunaneses who can't sustain hot spice.    

I am looking forward to PhD application end of this year. Please reach out to me with any questions via email!
