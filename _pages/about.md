It's me, Bowen Yi! As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, I research Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Sciences with [David Jurgens "the Great"](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Benjamin Litterer (as his first mentee)](https://twitter.com/BenLitterer). My research  integrates data analysis and network science to unravel social patterns and comprehend human behavior within its societal context. Additionally, I have a keen interest in exploring the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) within the healthcare sector. You can find our amazing research work at the [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/) website!
