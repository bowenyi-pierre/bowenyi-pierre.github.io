It's me, Bowen! I am a rising senior in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on **socially responsible NLP by causal inference**. Specifically, I am active in developing efficient CausalNLP to (1) promote the well-being of healthcare workers, and (2) identify event causality that affect vulnerable population. Beyond that, my long-term goal is to **understand the mechanism of LLMs' creativity**, and promote interpretable and truthful **NLP for social good**.      
 
I am proud to be part of the [LIT research group](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) and [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/), being supervised by [Rada Mihalcea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rada_Mihalcea), [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), [Veronica Perez-Rosas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yatiIigAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Maggie Makar](https://mymakar.github.io/).

 
Before my journey at Michigan, I grew up in [Yueyang, Hunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yueyang). I am one of the rare Hunaneses who can't sustain hot spice.     

I am applying to PhD programs end of this year. Please reach out to me with any questions via email!
