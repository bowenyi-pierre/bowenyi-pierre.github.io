    abstract = "The signing of Abraham Accords can promote the realization of the common interests 
among countries to a certain extent. However, it may also trigger some conflicts among nations. This 
paper mainly analyzes the important factors contributing to the signing of the Abraham Accords from 
three perspectives: (1) the external factors -- the intervention of the US; (2) the internal factors -- the 
Arab and Israelâ€™s adaptation to the current international situations; (3) other factors -- the impact of 
COVID-19, the dictatorship of Arab leaders, and the personal political pursuits of the leaders from 
other nations. In this paper, Classical Realism is used to analyze the interests between countries, 
and the influence of some political decisions made by relevant state leaders is supplemented by 
Neo-realism. Additionally, in this paper, Neoliberalism and Constructivism are also employed to 
analyze the negotiations between national interests, including compromise, containment, and 
obstruction, as well as how negotiations promote the realization of common interests. It is expected 
that this paper can be of some reference significance to future research on the interests between 
nations as well as their cooperation and conflicts in the context of globalization."
