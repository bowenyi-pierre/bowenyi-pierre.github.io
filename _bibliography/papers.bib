  abstract={Email serves as a vital conduit for human communication across businesses, organizations, and broader societal contexts. In this study, we aim to model the intents, expectations, and responsiveness in email exchanges. To this end, we create \dataset, a new dataset containing 1800 emails annotated with nuanced types of intents and expectations. We benchmark models ranging from feature-based logistic regression to zero-shot prompting of large language models. Leveraging the predictive model for intent, expectations, and 14 other categories of pragmatic features, we analyze 11.3M emails from GMANE to study the conversational dynamics in email exchanges. Through our causal analysis, we find that the email response rates are influenced by social status, argumentation, and in certain limited contexts, the strength of social connection. Our code and data are available upon acceptance.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the alignment of values in Large Language Models (LLMs) 
  with specific age groups, leveraging data from the World Value Survey across thirteen 
  categories. Through a diverse set of prompts tailored to ensure response robustness, 
  we find a general inclination of LLM values towards younger demographics, 
  especially in the US. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating 
  age identity information in prompts and observe challenges in mitigating value 
  discrepancies with different age cohorts. Our findings highlight the age bias in 
  LLMs and provide insights for future work. Materials for our analysis will be 
  available via anonymous.github.com},

    abstract = "The signing of Abraham Accords can promote the realization of the common interests 
among countries to a certain extent. However, it may also trigger some conflicts among nations. This 
paper mainly analyzes the important factors contributing to the signing of the Abraham Accords from 
three perspectives: (1) the external factors -- the intervention of the US; (2) the internal factors -- the 
Arab and Israelâ€™s adaptation to the current international situations; (3) other factors -- the impact of 
COVID-19, the dictatorship of Arab leaders, and the personal political pursuits of the leaders from 
other nations. In this paper, Classical Realism is used to analyze the interests between countries, 
and the influence of some political decisions made by relevant state leaders is supplemented by 
Neo-realism. Additionally, in this paper, Neoliberalism and Constructivism are also employed to 
analyze the negotiations between national interests, including compromise, containment, and 
obstruction, as well as how negotiations promote the realization of common interests. It is expected 
that this paper can be of some reference significance to future research on the interests between 
nations as well as their cooperation and conflicts in the context of globalization."
